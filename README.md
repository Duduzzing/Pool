# Pool - Common utilized library for ModPE
---

 - What is Pool?
 
  Pool is an 'utility' library for ModPE script developers, which will implement file IO and compression/decompression, and MC:PE object(blocks, entities, etc.) control. This project is a work in progress, so any other function could be added.
 
 
 - I am a ModPE script developer. How can I use this?
  
  [Pool Documentation/Wiki](https://github.com/if-Team/Pool/wiki) will be written after the first release.
